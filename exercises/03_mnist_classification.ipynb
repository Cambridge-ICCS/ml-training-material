    "However, in the case of images, or image-like objects, such models are less efficient for reasons we have discussed in the slides. When inputs are images, or image-like data, a more natural choice of model is a convolution neural network—in particularly, a model which uses 2D convolutional layers.\n",

    "### Task 1: Access the MNIST dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch has a (sort of) sister Python library for dealing with images: [``Torchvision``](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/index.html) (take a look at the website for a few minutes).\n",

    "\n",
    "- Look at the arguments of the MNIST datset: what options do we have?\n",
    "- Instantiate the (training) dataset.\n",
    "- Iterate over it: how are the inputs and targets presented to us?\n",
    "  - As before, we must supply transforms to maps between the raw data and ``torch.Tensor``s.\n",
    "  - Look at how we want to prepare the image tensors first.\n",
    "  - Look at how we want to prepare the target tensors second.\n",
    "- Plot some image tensors, and set their targets as the title, to make sure the data we feed to the model makes sense.\n",
    "- Create a validation dataset, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 2—(a)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a functioning dataset, as before, we could proceed and train our model. However, with images, we can often improve our model's abilitiy to generalise—and therefore produce more meaningful results—by employing data augmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are CNNs rotationally invariant?\n",
    "  - If we want out model still to work on images which are not of a regular orientation, we must use random rotations as a form of augmentation.\n",
    "- If we train a model on purely black-and-white images, how will it fare on more colourful data?\n",
    "- Go to ``Torchvision``'s [transforms](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html) and look at the the available forms of images augmentation.\n",
    "  - Take a few minutes to pick ones you think might be relevant.\n",
    "  - Let's discuss and choose some.\n",
    "- Now plot your augmentated data, as before, and make sure everything is in order.\n",
    "  -  It's _always_ _always_ _always_ a good idea to do this.\n",
    "- Note: applying data augmentations to the validation set is unconventional, so we can create our transforms in a function which optionally applies augmentations."
