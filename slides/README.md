# Slides

This directory contains the slides for the course.
These have been written in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) markdown and rendered to html
using quarto-cli.

As we develop the teaching materials further we may consider using the Jupyter or Python
features of Quarto to create dynamic content.


## Day 1 - ML and NN basics

- The concept of regression - how to fit a function
  - Gradient Descent
  - The structure of a NN - Just the same but bigger
  - Classification and regression
    - What are the differences - 2 main applications
  - Digression to PyTorch and basic python structure of a project
    - Simple example - Fully Connected Neural Network
    - How to train and run inference
  - Deeper theoretical details
    - Relu Layers, Activation functions, when to/not to use
    - How is data represented as a tensor
    - Some exercise to illustrate these?
    - Selecting an optimiser
  - Application of these ideas
    - Structuring a pytorch NN code
    - Multiple outputs
- How to make use of PyTorch Docs?
- Where to go for more information


## Day 2 - CNNs and more

- CNN
  - How is a CNN different from NNs?
    - Where to use?
    - Image-like problems - examples in climate data e.g. 2D or 3D fields
    - Segmentation/classification/regression?
      - What are these in this context?

- Applications
  - Upsampling/Downscaling
  - Interfacing with Models/languages
